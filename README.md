# Bingo
A program that automatically generates a bingo board and plays a bingo game by itself

-------------------CODED IN JAVA----------------

This program creates a bingo board with random numbers and creates a pool of 75 numbers that will be called and plays the bingo game by itself, showing the bingo board after each number is called from the pool of numbers.

In order to run the program the file called "BingoTester.java" is provided that will let the computer "play" the whole game of Bingo by itself.

(Note: the program will not result in a win every single time)

If a bingo game is won, the program will print how it won the game(diagnol bingo, horizontal bingo, vertical bingo, or four corners bingo) and will show what was the last number called.

If a number from the pool of numbers is found to be on the Bingo board it will be replaced with "0" to show that the specific entry is filled.
